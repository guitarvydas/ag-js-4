ag-js-4

This is an embellishment of ag-js, ag-js-2 and ag-js-3.

In this step, I create an HTML to factbase DSL transpiler using Ohm-JS.

I will explain what a factbase is.

I will explain why I use the name SCL to talk about things that are usually called DSLs.

Learn what you can from this version, then move on.
